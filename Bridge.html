    <h1>🌉 The Bridge</h1>
    <p>The bridge groans underfoot. Halfway across, a puzzle etched on a plank reads: "Commit early, commit often — what is the missing word?" A small note below says "Hint: starts with 'C'."</p>
  
    <p>Options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Boss.html">🧩 Solve by guessing 'Courage' and proceed</a></li>
      <li><a href="Pathroad.html">↩️ Step back from the bridge</a></li>
    </ul>
