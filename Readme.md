# The Coder's Quest â€” A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (HTML Only)

**A text-based adventure built purely with HTML.**  
No CSS. No JavaScript. Just interlinked pages that form a branching story.

## How to run
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click choices to navigate the story.

## Why this project stands out
- Big: ~12+ pages with branching paths.
- Creative: gamified developer theme (mentors, bugs, refactoring).
- Expandable: easy to add more branches, endings, ASCII art, or CSS later.
- Great GitHub project: shows planning, structure, storytelling, and persistence.

## Ideas to expand (without JS required)
- Add more pages and endings.
- Include ASCII art in `<pre>` blocks for flair.
- Organize a "walkthrough" HTML page that lists all possible endings.
- Convert story branches into a flowchart and include it as markdown.
